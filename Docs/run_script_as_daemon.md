To run it as a full daemon from a shell, you'll need to use `setsid` and redirect its output. You can redirect the output to a logfile, or to `/dev/null` to discard it. Assuming your script is called myscript.sh, use the following command:

    setsid myscript.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 < /dev/null &

This will completely detach the process from your current shell (stdin, stdout and stderr). If you want to keep the output in a logfile, replace the first `/dev/null` with your /path/to/logfile.

You have to redirect the output, otherwise it will not run as a true daemon (it will depend on your shell to read and write output).
